          <h2 class="intro__title">What didn't we see there?</h2>
          <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians
            dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their holidays
            in their native country. Like, what have we not seen here at home?
            In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the
            south, the dense forests of the Sayans and the harsh ice of the
            Putorana Plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without
            millions in your account, a passport and many hours of flights.
            Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took
            three children in her arms, put them in her Lada and drove 20
            thousand kilometers across her native country. We have selected
            described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

                Lagoon on one side and the rippling waves of the Baltic Sea on
                the other. A unique natural area on the edge of the Russian

                there. For a traveler and researcher, there is the westernmost
                point of Russia, the Baltic Spit, and the German heritage of a
                scattering of small seaside towns in the same neighborhood. The
                atmosphere of these places eliminates the fuss, dipping into the
                tranquility of nature and the smell of steel, cool sea.</p>

                places in Russia. First of all, because of the mountains: if you
                drive along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine
                trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in
                the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of
                these places - the mountain air.</p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so
                it is best to go here in summer. So you will see all the variety
                of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai,
                eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains.
                And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai
                Territory.</p>

              <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, it's all true. But Baikal
                is still an ideal place for skiing competitions. This is a sport
                where a skier ties himself to a motorcycle and the tandem tries
                to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019,
                a world record was set at the Baikal Mile festival - 197.011
                km/h.</p>

                Karelian national parks have never known an ax because of the

                Terrible saw it. In the virgin forest for a hundred kilometers
                you will not find a path. And on rare paths, trees a couple of
                meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. Let everyone
